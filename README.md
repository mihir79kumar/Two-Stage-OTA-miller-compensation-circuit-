# Design and Analysis of Two-Stage CMOS Operational Amplifier using eSim

## Overview  
This project presents the design and analysis of a **two-stage CMOS operational amplifier** implemented using **eSim** and **Ngspice** at a **1.8 V** supply voltage.  
The amplifier ensures all MOSFETs operate in the saturation region to achieve **high gain**, **good stability**, and **wide bandwidth**.

## Tools Used  
- **eSim** â€“ Open-source EDA tool developed by *FOSSEE, IIT Bombay*, integrating KiCad, Ngspice, and GHDL.  
- **Ngspice** â€“ Open-source SPICE simulator for analog and mixed-signal circuit analysis.  
- **Magic** *(optional, for layout)* â€“ Open-source VLSI layout editor for Sky130 PDK and other technologies.

## Circuit Description  
The amplifier consists of **two stages**:  

1. **Differential Amplifier Stage** â€“ Transistors M1â€“M4 form a differential pair with active loads, converting differential input into single-ended output with high gain.  
2. **Gain Stage** â€“ A PMOS common-source amplifier (M6) with active NMOS load increases overall voltage gain and swing.  

A **600 fF compensation capacitor** ensures stability, and a **2 pF load capacitor** models the output load.

## Simulation Results  
Simulations were performed in **Ngspice** using `.cir` files generated from eSim.  
- **DC Gain and Frequency Response** confirm high gain and stability.  
- **Phase Margin â‰ˆ 60Â°** indicates good compensation.

## Layout and Analysis  
If layout is designed using **Magic** and **Sky130 PDK**, post-layout simulation can be done to compare results with pre-layout analysis.  

---

## Future Scope  
- Implement using **Sky130 PDK** for fabrication-level verification.  
- Optimize transistor sizing for higher bandwidth and lower power.  
- Extend to **fully differential** or **folded-cascode** architectures.
